Mail
----

SPF (Sender Policy Framework) 
	DNS text entry allowing a server to send mail for a specific domain

DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)
	Used to verify messages content
	DNS entry with a public (DKIM) Key
	
		- Server signs message
			(adds DKIM-Signature to Email header)
	
		- Receiver verifies message
			(Checks MX server for DKIM-KEY if false message changed and failure)
	

DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance)
	Sets a policy for (Sender Policy Framework) and (Domain Keys Identified Mail)

		- Receiving server checks against the policy on how to proceed
		- Reporting Address for the domain


(Sender Policy framework) does not work in shared hosting as they all use the same IP
(Domain Keys Identified Mail) requires a DMARC policy
